# Hazina Escrow Contract

The Soroban contract now supports:

- A default platform fee plus dataset-specific fee overrides
- Admin-managed whitelist and blacklist controls for buyer and seller addresses
- An admin-controlled pause/unpause circuit breaker for emergencies
- An admin-only upgrade path for swapping the current WASM executable
- Invariant-focused verification tests that can be run independently
- Buyer-confirmed release flow and expiry-based seller claims
- `emergency_withdraw` for stuck tokens (admin-only, contract must be paused)

## Emergency withdrawal policy

`emergency_withdraw` is an escape hatch for stuck assets and is intentionally constrained:

- Only the contract admin can call it.
- The contract must be paused first.
- Every withdrawal emits an `emerg_wd` event with `(token, to, amount)`.

## Input validation

`lock()` now rejects invalid inputs early:

- `amount` must be greater than zero
- `dataset_id` must not be empty
- the token address must resolve to a valid token contract
- buyer and seller must be different addresses
- seller must not be the contract address placeholder used for invalid addresses

These checks fail before any transfer is attempted, which keeps contract state and balances consistent.

## Upgrades

The contract exposes an admin-only `upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)` entrypoint that calls Soroban's built-in `update_current_contract_wasm` host function.

Upgrade flow:

1. Build and upload the new contract Wasm to Stellar.
2. Capture the returned Wasm hash.
3. Call `upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)` from the current admin address.
4. Verify the deployment by re-reading the existing escrow state.

The upgrade call requires admin authentication. Non-admin callers are rejected.

## Verification scripts

From the repository root:

```sh
npm run contracts:check
npm run contracts:formal
```

`contracts:check` runs formatting, clippy, the full Rust test suite, and a release wasm build.

`contracts:formal` runs the invariant-oriented tests whose names start with `formal_`.

## Integration Tests (Stellar Testnet)

These tests run against the real Stellar testnet. They are ignored by default.

### Setup

1.  **Fund accounts**: Create and fund three accounts on testnet (Admin, Buyer, Seller). You can use the [Stellar Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator).
2.  **USDC Trustlines**: Ensure the Buyer and Seller accounts have trustlines for USDC on testnet (`GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5`).
3.  **Fund Buyer with USDC**: Send some testnet USDC to the Buyer account.
4.  **Configure Env**: Copy `contracts/hazina-escrow/.env.test` and fill in the real secrets and contract ID.

### Running

From `contracts/hazina-escrow`:

```sh
cargo test -- --ignored
```

Or specific test:

```sh
cargo test integration_lock_and_release -- --ignored
```
